'''
A string is good if there are no repeated characters.

Given a string s​​​​​, return the number of good substrings of length three in s​​​​​​.

Note that if there are multiple occurrences of the same substring, every occurrence should be counted.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "xyzzaz"
Output: 1
Explanation: There are 4 substrings of size 3: "xyz", "yzz", "zza", and "zaz". 
The only good substring of length 3 is "xyz".
